# **Uniswap V4 Hooks Analysis: Simulating Dynamic Fees**

## **Overview**
This repository contains a Python simulation that explores the impact of **Uniswap V4 hooks** on transaction costs, trading volume, and liquidity in the Ethereum network. By introducing **dynamic fee adjustments** (reward and penalty mechanisms), the simulation models how fee changes affect trader behavior and network efficiency.

## **Purpose of the Project**
The project analyzes:
1. **Dynamic Fees**: How fee adjustments (penalties for small swaps, rewards for volatile markets) influence transaction costs.
2. **Elasticity of Demand**: How transaction volume reacts to fee changes.
3. **Liquidity Migration**: How excessive fees cause traders to exit pools, reducing active liquidity.
4. **Scalability Impact**: Implications of dynamic fees for Ethereum's network efficiency and load balancing.

## **Methodology**
The simulation uses Python to model trader behavior and visualize the results. Key steps include:

1. **System Parameters**:
   - Simulated 1000 traders with varied swap sizes using an **exponential distribution**.
   - A **base fee** of 0.3% and a **fixed gas cost** are used as benchmarks.

2. **Dynamic Fee Model**:
   - Small swaps are penalized with **double fees**.
   - High market volatility rewards traders with **halved fees**.

3. **Transaction Costs**:
   - Total transaction cost is calculated as:
     ```math
     \text{Total Cost} = (\text{Swap Size} \times \text{Fee}) + \text{Gas Cost}
     ```

4. **Elasticity of Demand**:
   - Simulates how increased fees reduce trading volume based on an elasticity coefficient.

5. **Liquidity Migration**:
   - Models trader exits when fees exceed a threshold (e.g., 1.5x base fees).
